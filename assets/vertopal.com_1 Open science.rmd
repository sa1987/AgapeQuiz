# **Open science**

Let's start at the beginning.

**Open science** is a movement to make scientific research, data and
their dissemination available to any member of an inquiring society,
from professionals to citizens.

Open science comprises several themes from conception to dissemination
of knowledge. Based on principles of scientific growth and public
access, open science includes practices such as open publishing and
campaigning for open access, with the ultimate aim of making it easier
to publish and share scientific knowledge.

## **What is open science?**

Open science refers to a vision to improve scientific practices for
reproducibility, transparency, sharing and collaboration of knowledge.
Multiple pathways to achieving this vision have developed since the
concept emerged in 1985 ([Chubin, 1985]{.ul}).

As part of the global open science community, we expand the term
"science" beyond its common use, such as life sciences or engineering,
to include the arts, humanities and any other scholarly activities. Open
science, open research and open scholarship are often used
interchangeably. For consistency and ease of understanding, we use open
science in this course.

**Open science = open research = open scholarship**

Generally, the open science movement identifies increased openness of
scientific content, tools and processes as the key means of action.
However, a single definition cannot encompass the diversity of the open
science movement. Therefore, we give some alternative definitions of the
phrase **open science** throughout this chapter.

The first definition we review is from the European [[FOSTER
project]{.ul}](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/). According to the
FOSTER team, "open science is the practice of science in such a way that
others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes
and other research processes are freely available, under terms that
enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its
underlying data and methods." This definition highlights that open
science is the act of improving access and contribution to all aspects
of scientific practice: from research design, methodologies and tools,
generated data, reporting and evaluation.

In an attempt to capture the complexity of open science, Fecher &
Friesike
([[2014]{.ul}](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236607487_Open_Science_One_Term_Five_Schools_of_Thought))
define it as "an umbrella term encompassing a multitude of assumptions
about the future of knowledge creation and dissemination". The authors
summarise the movement complexity by identifying five schools of
thought. Namely, the democratic school (concerned with knowledge
access), the public school (concerned with accessibility to knowledge
creation), the measurement school (concerned with alternative impact
measurement), the infrastructure school (concerned with the
technological architecture of science) and the pragmatic school
(concerned with collaborative research). This (somewhat arbitrary)
separation highlights the various paths in which science can be
"opened".

Based on a review of published definitions and information Vicente-Saez
and Martinez-Fuentes
([[2018]{.ul}](https://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/143111.pdf))
concluded that "open science is transparent and accessible knowledge
that is shared and developed through collaborative networks". Here,
knowledge includes code, data, ideas, information, scientific outputs,
scientific publications and scientific results. Paic
([[2021]{.ul}](https://goingdigital.oecd.org/data/notes/No13_ToolkitNote_OpenScience.pdf))
identified emerging trends in open science such as alternative
reputation systems, open notebooks, open lab books, science blogs,
collaborative bibliographies, citizen science and open peer-review.

Another definition we would like to present is the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation
([[UNESCO]{.ul}](https://www.unesco.org/en)) definition. Drafted at the
40^th^ UNESCO General Conference in 2019 and officially published in
2021, the [[Recommendation on Open
Science]{.ul}](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation)
contains the following statement: "For the purpose of this
Recommendation, open science is defined as an inclusive construct that
combines various movements and practices, aiming to make multilingual
scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for
everyone. It also aims to increase scientific collaboration and sharing
of information for the benefit of science and society and to open the
processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication
to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community. It
comprises all scientific disciplines and aspects of scholarly practices,
including basic and applied sciences, natural and social sciences and
the humanities and it builds on the following key pillars: open
scientific knowledge, open science infrastructures, science
communication, open engagement of societal actors and open dialogue with
other knowledge systems."

Here, the UNESCO members clarify the meaning of the term science to
include the humanities and the liberal arts. Furthermore, this
definition highlights how the open science movement broadens its areas
of influence beyond general research practices to the researcher
community and society at large. The movement thus aims to better the
inclusion of diverse ethnicities, cultures, languages, backgrounds and
availability of resources across the scientific community.

Lastly, [[The Turing Way
Community]{.ul}](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) (2021)
illustrates open research and its subcomponents as fitting under the
umbrella of the broader concept of open scholarship in their handbook on
reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science. These
subcomponents are open data, open-source software, open-source hardware,
open access, open notebooks, open educational resources, citizen
science, equity, diversity and inclusion.

Many other definitions of open science can be found online or within
written records. However, in consolidating the mentioned sources
together, we conclude that six unifying principles and core values
characterise the open science movement. These are:

-   Transparency, scrutiny, critique and reproducibility

-   Equality of opportunities

-   Responsibility, respect and accountability

-   Collaboration, participation and inclusion

-   Flexibility

-   Sustainability

## **The history of open science**

Previously, we mentioned the vision and principles the open science
movement shares. To better understand the implications opening science
might have, it is useful to appreciate how the contemporary values and
principles of both science and open science came to be. As Watson
([[2015]{.ul}](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0669-2))
suggests, science is easily perceived as already "open", as already
belonging to everyone. However, contemporary science is much more recent
than one may think and its organisation has greatly transformed over the
last 500 years. Even the current dominant practices of science are not
immutable and they are likely to continue to change again in the future,
evolving within the broader context of society.

**17th to 20th century: The emergence of contemporary science**

*"For in the sciences the authority of thousands of opinions is not
worth as much as one tiny spark of reason in an individual man."*

\[Galileo Galilei, ca. 1597\]

Between the 17^th^ and 20^th^ century, science underwent multiple
reformations. If you were to meet scientists from before the 17^th^
century, their perception of science would probably shock you. For
centuries, they had more or less accepted the authority of the Church
and of monarchs and their claims and theories didn't need to be backed
up with either observable proof or the proof of reason. During the
reformation, profound advancements in science took place and the
scientific community gradually adopted scientific publications, formal
review processes, scholarly associations, public grants and many more of
the common modern practices.

The advent of printing and publishing companies in the early 17th
century made public libraries more and more common. Knowledge started to
accumulate in printed reports and encyclopaedias and, for the first
time, it became accessible to the general public. At the time, this
meant mostly privileged male and white citizens with greater
socioeconomic resources and greater perceived standing in the social
hierarchy.

During the same period, scholars started to move from unstable
aristocratic patronages to assembled academies of science, slowly
adopting academic publishing. Merton
([[1963]{.ul}](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-sociology-archives-europeennes-de-sociologie/article/abs/resistance-to-the-systematic-study-of-multiple-discoveries-in-science/8FEC108B3D8B0DAD60416B36BE342959))
tells us that between the 1650s and the 1850s, the number of
simultaneous discoveries ending in disputes dropped from 92% to 33%.
Cryptic monographs and academic duels slowly became a thing of the past
and science gradually became more open.

*"The assumption that peer review is as old as journal publishing
\[...\] is based on a misunderstanding of Philosophical Transactions'
editorial practice. \[...\] Indeed, for most of the history of
scientific journals, it has been editors -- not referees -- who have
been the key decision-makers and gatekeepers."*

\[Aileen Fyfe, 2015\]

After the establishment of scientific publishing and academic societies,
the development of a formal review process developed between the 19th
century and first half of the 20th century. We might take today's
practice of **peer-review**, in which one or more people with similar
competencies (peers) as the author review a manuscript before
publication on a voluntary basis, for granted. However, it took until
the 1970s before peer-review became widespread. ([[Fyfe,
2015]{.ul}](https://web.archive.org/web/20220316123936/https:/www.timeshighereducation.com/features/peer-review-not-old-you-might-think)).

The first recognized formal review practice was implemented by the
British Royal Society in 1832. A special committee within the society
was responsible for accepting or rejecting submissions for publication
based on independently written evaluations. George Gabriel Stokes,
secretary of the Royal Society from 1854--1885, further refined this
practice by sharing the referees' suggestions with the authors and
facilitating the discussion between authors and referees. Similar review
processes started to become common practice in other academic societies
across the world during the 19th century.

On the other hand, private publishers would only introduce formal review
practices in the 20^th^ century and the journal editor(s) were the sole
judge of acceptance or rejection of a submission. These trivial
selection practices allowed for a fast research-to-publication cycle,
making private journals appealing for swift communication between
scientists. At this stage, societies' journals gradually hosted fewer
and more refined publications, while private journals were the preferred
communication channel between scientists.

**Modern science and the fight for openness**

As submissions grew in volume, private journals started to implement
review practices in the second half of the 20th century, gradually
bringing us to the current state of research practices. However, with
private publishers flourishing, new economic and structural barriers to
scientific knowledge arose. For example, nowadays a yearly subscription
to a scientific journal can cost between 3,000 and 7,000 USD
([[Bosch]{.ul} [*et al*.,
2022]{.ul}](https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/Are-We-There-Yet-Periodicals-Price-Survey-2022))
compared with much more affordable mainstream media subscriptions. For
example, the New York Times offers a yearly subscription for 20 USD.

Much of today\'s scientific publication is in the hands of five large
publishing companies: American Chemical Society (ACS), Elsevier,
Springer-Nature, Taylor & Francis and Wiley-Blackwell, who own 50 to 70%
of the scientific writing market ([Puehringer et al., 2021]{.ul}). A
sentiment of anger is often apparent in scientific communities towards
the private publishing sector. For example, Buranyi
([[2017]{.ul}](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science))
explains that "Scientists create work under their own direction --
funded largely by governments -- and give it to publishers for free. The
publisher pays scientific editors who judge whether the work is worth
publishing and check its grammar, but the bulk of the editorial burden
\[\...\] is done by working scientists on a volunteer basis. The
publishers then sell the product back to government-funded institutional
and university libraries, to be read by scientists -- who, in a
collective sense, created the product in the first place."

The roots of open science stem from philosophical discussions ongoing in
the 1970s and 1980s about what it means to have freely available
scientific knowledge and not in the fight for more just publication
practices ([Chubin, 1985]{.ul}). However, we believe that the struggle
for open access publication spurred the rise of the open science
movement, which then drew together all of the elements previously
mentioned.

A second steppingstone in the history of the open science movement was
the advent of the Internet. From its infancy, the Internet shifted how
information is shared and facilitated new methods of scientific
exchanges. Literature research moved from public libraries to online
repositories such as the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) which
was launched in 2003 with 300 open access journals. Scientists also
began to share early versions of their work or pre-prints through
servers such as [[Biorxiv]{.ul}](https://www.biorxiv.org/). Furthermore,
online collaboration facilitated easily accessible information resources
such as [[Wikipedia]{.ul}](https://en.wikipedia.org/) which became a
household staple. A new reformation of science had begun.

"*The question is no longer whether open science is happening, but how
everyone can contribute to it and benefit from this transition.*"

\[Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO, 2021\]
