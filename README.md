<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

Welcome to our open science initiative! Under our Agape initiative, we aim to get early career researchers in Ireland involved in the open science movement and to build an open science practising community.

Under Agape we aim to disseminate open science between PhD students and early career researchers across Ireland and later internationally. We want to create an open science practising community where we can learn, exchange our opinions and experiences, and together change the future. In the way that science is undertaken, made freely available, and communicated in a FAIR and transparent way.

Start the learning by checking out our <a href="https://agape-openscience-blog.netlify.app"><strong> agape blog »</strong></a>
