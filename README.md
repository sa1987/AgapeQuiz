<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

Welcome to our open science initiative! Under our Agape initiative, we aim to get early career researchers in Ireland involved in the open science movement and to build an open science practising community.

Under Agape we aim to disseminate open science between PhD students and early career researchers across Ireland and later internationally. We want to create an open science practising community where we can learn, exchange our opinions and experiences, and together change the future. In the way that science is undertaken, made freely available, and communicated in a FAIR and transparent way.

### Agape Quiz 

Agape quiz is a java script based online quiz hosted through GitHub, as a part of the Agape initiative. You can create your own quiz and certificates using the Agape quiz template.
The quiz has multiple choice questions, timer and certificate generator. The certificate generator feature become accessible only of you meet the cut-off score(at least 90%) and you can customize the certificate by adding your name. Each certificate comes with a unique id and the score, unique ID and name is saved only in your local cache. 

Some of the features of the quiz are :
Score system
Highscore board
Dynamic progress bar
Restart and clear button
Customizable certificate generator
